# My dwm (dynamic window manager) build

Dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X. Dwm is created by [suckless.org](https://suckless.org).  This is my personal build of dwm.  I used a number of patches in this build:
+ alpha (for transparency)
+ attachaside (new clients appear in the stack rather than as the master)
+ cyclelayouts (cycles through the available layouts)
+ gridmode (adding a grid layout)
+ restartsig (allows dwm to be restarted with a keybinding)
+ rotatestack (moves a window through the stack, in either direction)
+ statuspadding (horizontal and vertical padding in the status bar are now configurable options)
+ titlecolor (Adds title bar color scheme, seperating it from SchemeSel)
+ uselessgap (adding gaps when more than one window)
